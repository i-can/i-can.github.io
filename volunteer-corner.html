Team is a privilege, honor, rewarding, and humbling experience.&nbsp; To be with the other dedicated, friendly, caring volunteers, stakeholders, and most importantly, the cancer patients, is very uplifting and heartwarming.&nbsp; The atmosphere is filled with warmth, hope, dedication, and sincere compassion for all involved.&nbsp; I highly recommend it to those looking for a meaningful experience, where you are guaranteed to receive more than you give.&nbsp; I am absolutely, positively convinced that Mary Stephenson could not be more proud of what her son, Richard, has achieved in creating such a positive atmosphere and environment, for this important work of curing, caring, and respecting people, who are struggling in the fight of their lives.</p>

I am not exactly a big dog lover. In fact, truth be told, I'm afraid of them. My dog lover friends often try to help me overcome this&nbsp defect. &nbsp;They take it as a personal affront that I don't have automatic affection for their extended family member. I have made progress with this issue. Blessing of the&nbsp;Paws was a huge step for me; but now I've had another breakthrough. I met Savannah.&nbsp;. <br>
                  Savannah was waiting for our&nbsp;Community of Hope&nbsp;ministry team from St. Peter's to arrive at the Cancer Treatment Center. The team offers a prayer and healing service once a month and takes communion to patients who are receiving treatments at the center. &nbsp;I braced myself for the encounter;&nbsp;but as soon as the front doors opened and I spotted Savannah, I knew there was something different about this dog. Savannah is technically known as a trained therapy dog, but to me she fits better into&nbsp;the spirit category.<br>
                  As the team walked the halls of the center and stopped in individual rooms to offer prayers and communion, Savannah&nbsp;offered a calmness and peace to everyone we met. Some were well enough to pet her beautiful coat; but when they were too sick, Savannah would rest her head gently and compassionately on the bed.&nbsp;Her spirit filled the room with joy and comfort. Surely this had to be more than a dog!.<br>
                  I realized I was sad when Savannah had to leave. Her owner, who is a new parishioner at St. Peter's, said it was time for her to go home.&nbsp;Such a spirit has to get some rest and recharge. Thank you Savannah for what you bring to all whom you meet.<br>

               A Level of Compassion and Kindness I Have Never Seen Before</h2>

               Walking through the doors at Cancer Treatment Centers of America for the first time was a surreal experience. I could not believe I was actually in a hospital. Before going to CTCA I thought that their slogan "The Mother Standard of Care," was just another advertising strategy used to gain patients, but oh how wrong I was. Every patient is cared for in a way that most mothers would be jealous of, they are definitely more than a number in a system, and that makes for a great hospital. From the moment I step foot in the door, I was surrounded by a level of compassion and kindness I have never seen before, and I knew it was going to be a life changing opportunity. Every person showed a sense of love and excitement for life, from stakeholders to volunteers to patients. CTCA's culture is so different from any other company I have ever seen and I have to say that companies would prosper with the use of their method.&nbsp;. <br>
                 Going through the hospital observing and learning gave me an insight to what happens in the background, and I can honestly say that it is just as great as what you see out in the open. The Teen Leadership Program is such a good experience; it changes your outlook on life, creates life long bonds, and establishes memories that you will never forget. I can say that I will be laughing for years to come, when I think back to my time at CTCA, and I am very grateful for that.  Traveling to each department and seeing what they do was great, I learned a lot about various things that I would not have otherwise had the opportunity. I, also, have to mention the delicious food, which is nothing like what you are served at a regular hospital. Overall, I have learned a lot from every department, and it makes me proud to say that I was a part of the Teen Leadership Program. I would recommend it to anyone.<br>
